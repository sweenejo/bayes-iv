## Valid Instruments

- Satisfy the exclusion restriction
- Satisfy the monotonicity assumption
- 

## Valid Instruments

- These assumptions are relevant whether you use IVs to evaluate causality or in traditional simultaneous equation models.

## The Phenomenological Bayesian Approach

- Causal inference is framed in terms of potentially observable outcomes for all units to all treatments.
- What about the counterfactual problem?
-- It doesn't exist for Bayesians.

## In the morning
```{r}
# Generate data
n <- 1000
z <- rnorm(n)
x <- 1 + 2*z + rnorm(n)

# True model specified by instrument
e <- rnorm(n, 1)
y <- 3 + 1.5*2*x + e
```

## Getting up

- Turn off alarm
- Get out of bed
